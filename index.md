    <li><strong><u>Development of Economic Models for Carbon Capture & Storage:</u></strong> Working on a Cooperative Game Theoretic model for carbon dioxide emitters in Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia Romagna, known as the  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221715004245" target="_blank"> CCS Club!</a>, first introduced by Massol et al. (2015). Enhances were made in the model, including the integration of a multi-objective optimization procedure that treats carbon dioxide as a marketable product. Based on this, we constructed a utility function to isolate an optimal point drawing from my recent publication <a href="#pubs">(2)</a>. A conference paper and a publication are planned for 2024.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong><u>Decarbonization of a Residential House in EU:</u></strong> Few years ago, my family in Cyprus decided to upgrade our house in Limassol to Net-Zero. I designed the insulation and photovoltaic system and computed the investment costs. This groundwork evolved into a novel stochastic cashflow model for assessing the project's profitability. Currently, we are generalizing the model for the whole market of Cyprus, shaping the input distribution functions of this model based on behavioral economics. A conference paper and a publication are planned for 2024.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong><u>Modelling Energy Transition in the European Electricity and Gas System via PLEXOS:</u></strong> We offer consultancy services to firms interested in modeling the electricity and gas markets using <a href="https://www.energyexemplar.com/plexos" target="_blank">PLEXOS</a>. Beyond modeling, I provide software development solutions (AWS, API integration, automation).

    <li><strong><u>FLINUGEE project:</u></strong> (Fluid Injection in Unconsolidated formations for Geo Energy and Environmental Applications - EXCELLENCE/0421/0456), funded by the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Granted:</strong> €200,000</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>Mathematical and Computational Modelling of Geo-Energy Processes:</u></strong> We developed a screening tool using the material balance approach for carbon dioxide injection with water influx. The tool addresses two injection scenarios: depleted gas reservoirs and piston-like injection for Enhanced Gas Recovery. It is adaptable for both dry and condensate reservoirs, considering reservoir heterogeneities through stochastic petrophysical properties. Our model, inspired by <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-70163-5" target="_blank"> Bentley et al (2017)</a>, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-33113-9" target="_blank"> Ringrose (2020)</a>, offers grid-independent techniques and addresses the socio-economic challenges of CCS by position carbon dioxide as a marketable product. This work resulted in a publication (see <a href="#pubs">(2)</a>) and will be instrumental in the development of a future socio-economic model (see my work at <a href="#feem">FEEM</a>). We are currently enhancing the model for Hydrogen Storage, introducing "pseudo-dispersion" and planning to integrate it with geomechanics simulators.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong><u>Field Development Strategies:</u></strong> During my MEng thesis at University of Cyprus, we used Petrel and MATLAB to simulate the Norwegian section of the Frigg field, leading to several innovative strategies for Field Development Plans. Our key innovations presented at <a href="https://erc.aapg.org/2023" target="_blank"> AAPG Europe Regional Conference</a>, <a href="https://eage.eventsair.com/east-med-2023/event-overview" target="_blank"> 4th EAGE Eastern Mediterranean Workshop</a>, and set to be detailed in publication (see <a href="#pubs">(4)</a>), encompass the application of carbon dioxide piston-like injection for Enhanced Gas Recovery, referencing methodology from <a href="#pubs">(2)</a>; a semi-stochastic algorithm for optimal double section casing design that minimizes drilling costs using real-market configurations (heuristic filter-and-sort method); a kernel algorithm assessing spatial accident risk in the field, factoring in distance and Points of Interest, from facilities to personnel; and a stochastic approach to Project Economics, accounting for uncertainties like production delays, gas price fluctuations and CAPEX and OPEX. Notably, several of these strategies have been integrated into the master’s curriculum for new students, which I am instructing.

    <li><strong><u><a href="http://biolisys.cut.ac.cy/research/projects/active-projects/nitoxilico/" target="_blank">"NITOXILICO" project:</a></u></strong> (POST-DOC/0916/0237), funded by the Cyprus Research and Innovation Foundation.

            <li><strong>Achievement:</strong> Contributor to patent <a href="https://ktisis.cut.ac.cy/handle/20.500.14279/29213" target="_blank">(PCT/EP2022/064468)</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>Parameterization & Optimization of Predictive Physiological Based Toxicokinetic (PBTK) Models:</u></strong> We pioneered a predictive compartmental PBTK model to assess Nickel leaching from cardiovascular devices. We conducted in-house animal experiments, integrating the data into a time-variant system of ODEs. The system was framed within a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to balance various physiological and device-specific parameters across the compartments (organs). Inherent to such models, data limitations and measurement uncertainties introduced a high degree of non-smoothness to the model’s objective function. Τo address this, we employed global optimization algorithms and stochastic analysis. This work resulted in three publications (see <a href="#pubs">(1)</a>, <a href="#pubs">(3)</a> & <a href="#pubs">(5)</a>). We are now expanding our research to simulate the interactions in the peri-implant environment using PDEs. The current model offers valuable insights to stent manufacturers about device leachability, aiding in risk assessment and minimizing the need for additional animal testing. We are in the process of developing a platform to offer this service, with plans for monetization.

<ul>
    <li><strong><u>Thermodynamic Control of Reactive Spontaneous Systems:</u></strong> In collaboration with my undergraduate thesis advisor, Dr. Nicos Angastiniotis, we delved into the fundamentals of materials thermodynamics. Through theoretical groundwork, MATLAB simulation studies, and hands-on experimental work, we aimed to regulate the equilibrium state of chemical reactions. Our approach focuses on adjusting the rate of change of auxiliary functions as reactions evolve. Specifically, we control the rate of change of chemical work in relation to the invoked shifts in thermal and configurational entropy by adjusting the reaction's independent variables. Before the experimental work, we simulate the attainment of the desired equilibrium state using tailor-made in-house algorithms. Our objective is the synthesis of bulk amorphous tungsten nanostructures to be used as templates for the fabrication of tungsten carbide and oxides, for industrial applications.

<ul>
    <li><strong><u>Characterization and Fabrication of Organic Nanomaterials & Electronic Devices:</u></strong> Experimental work was conducted centered on the dichroism properties of the oligomer CBP (4,4′-Bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl), structured around the materials science tetrahedron. <strong>Processing</strong>: I employed spin coating to deposit CBP into thin films. By varying spin coating speeds and applying thermal annealing, I influenced the film's microstructure. <strong>Structure</strong>: Post-deposition, I used optical microscopy to examine the microstructure of the films, gaining insights into their formation and arrangement. <strong>Properties</strong>: I conducted UV-Vis measurements, incorporating a polarizer to delve into the material's dichroism, a result of observed anisotropy in the structure. This allowed me to generate spectra for the films under different processing conditions. <strong>Performance</strong>: While I didn't directly test the performance of devices fabricated with CBP, I have experience fabricating and measuring the performance of devices using various organic materials like ITO/PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:PCBM. These devices, including Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs) and Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), were created using various deposition techniques such as doctor blade, inkjet printing, and sputtering. I also employed further structural characterization tools like the profilometer and performance assessment methods like solar simulators.

    <li><strong><u>Fabrication & Characterization of Supercapacitors:</u></strong> I delved into supercapacitors' principles, highlighting the capabilities derived from activated carbon's surface area and the Helmholtz electric double layer's thickness. Using materials like aluminum foil, activated carbon from water filters, glue, and saltwater, I fabricated various configurations of home-made supercapacitors, experimenting with carbon grinding durations, salt solutions, and glue quantities and I finally examined the nanostructure of selected electrodes through Scanning Electrode Microscopy. Concurrently, I engaged in X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) studies, practicing with Reference Intensity Ratio (RIR) quantitative phase analysis and Match! Software, to further explore advanced electrode configurations via techniques like Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).
