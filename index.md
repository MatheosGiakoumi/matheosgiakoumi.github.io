[Creative Footprint - NYC / Tokyo / Berlin / Stockholm](https://www.creative-footprint.org/)
<br>
<br>Client - Vibe Lab
<br>
The Creative Footprint (CFP) is a sociocultural initiative that maps and indexes creative space to measure the impact of nightlife and cultural activity on cities.<br>
<br>
I developed a geo-spatial methodology to get deep insights about how creative spaces are related to economic and demographic indicators and how they are affected by land use policies and transportation networks.<br>
